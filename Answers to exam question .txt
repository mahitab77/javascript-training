Answers to exam question 

answer to question 1:


1. Difference between "var" and "let" keywords in JavaScript:

    - var: 
       -Function-scoped. A variable declared with `var` is accessible throughout the entire function it's declared in, or globally if declared outside of any function.
       -Can be redeclared within the same scope, potentially overwriting the previous value.
       -They can be accessed before their declaration, but their value will be "undefined".     
    - let: 
       -Block-scoped. A variable declared with `let` is only accessible within the block (code enclosed in curly braces `{}`) where it's declared. 
       -Cannot be redeclared within the same block. 
       -They cannot be accessed before their declaration.



2. Difference between "==" and "===" operators:

   - "==": Performs loose comparison, without type.
   - "===": Performs strict comparison, checking both value and type equality. 



3. Difference between "while" and "for" loops:

- "while" loop:
   - Continues executing the loop body as long as the specified condition evaluates to true.
   - Useful when you don't know the exact number of iterations beforehand.

- "for" loop:
   - for loop involves initialization, condition checking, and updating in a single line.
 

4. Difference between "if" and "switch" statements:

- "if" statement:
   - Executes a block of code if a specified condition is `true`. Optionally, executes alternative blocks if other conditions are met (using "else if") or a final default block ("else").
   - Suitable for handling multiple conditions or complex logic.

- "switch" statement:
   - Evaluates an expression and compares its value against a series of cases. If a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed.
